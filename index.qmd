Hi, I am a PhD researcher at the School of Politics and International Relations in University College Dublin and an affiliate to the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/). 

My research analyzes __strategic political communication__ in EU institutions during crises using computational methods. Methodologically, I apply __NLP__ and __quantitative approaches__ to analyse text corpora, and identify causal relationships.

I am a contributor and research assistant in the [Irish Polling Indicator Project](https://pollingindicator.com/) and a co-author of the [Irish Demographic Polling](https://github.com/Irish-Dem-Polling/datasets) and the [Irish Local and European Parliament Election Manifestos](https://github.com/stefan-mueller/iemanifestos) datasets. Previously, I worked for [Global Affairs Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/global-affairs-affaires-mondiales/home-accueil.aspx?lang=eng) in their office in Ireland and Ecuador.  

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:paula.montano1@gmail.com) to discuss potential collaborations or if you are interested in my research.
