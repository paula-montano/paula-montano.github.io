:::{#welcome}

::: {.justify}

Welcome! I am a PhD researcher at the School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin. My research interests lie in the intersection of **political communication**, **EU politics**, and **computational social science**. 

My PhD project analyses **strategic political communication** in EU institutions during crises using **NLP** and **quantitative methods**, such as machine learning and large language models, to analyse textual **data** and identify causal relationships.   

I am also a contributor and research assistant in the [Irish Polling Indicator](https://pollingindicator.com/) project, and a co-author of the [Irish Demographic Polling Data](https://github.com/Irish-Dem-Polling/datasets) and the [Irish Local and European Elections Manifestos](https://github.com/stefan-mueller/iemanifestos).

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:paula.montano1@gmail.com) to explore collaboration opportunities or to share PhD journey experiences. Check more about my [research](research.qmd), [teaching](teaching.qmd) and [CV](CV_Montano_Paula.pdf).
